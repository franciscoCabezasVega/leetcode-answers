The following describes the folder structure and the purpose of each one.

| Folder | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[`001. Two Sum`](/001.%20Two%20Sum/README.md)** | Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to `target`. |
| **[`002. Add Two Numbers`](/002.%20Add%20Two%20Numbers/README.md)** | You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. |
| **[`003. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters`](/003.%20Longest%20Substring%20Without%20Repeating%20Characters/README.md)** | Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters. |
| **[`004. Median of Two Sorted Arrays`](/004.%20Median%20of%20Two%20Sorted%20Arrays/README.md)** | Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. |
| **[`005. Longest Palindromic Substring`](/005.%20Longest%20Palindromic%20Substring/README.md)** | Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`. |
| **[`006. Zigzag Conversion`](/006.%20Zigzag%20Conversion/README.md)** | The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility). |
| **[`007. Reverse Integer`](/007.%20Reverse%20Integer/README.md)** | Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`. |
| **[`008. String to Integer (atoi)`](/008.%20String%20to%20Integer%20(atoi)/README.md)** | Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer. |
| **[`009. Palindrome Number`](/009.%20Palindrome%20Number/README.md)** | Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise. |
| **[`010. Regular Expression Matching`](/010.%20Regular%20Expression%20Matching/README.md)** | Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where: |
