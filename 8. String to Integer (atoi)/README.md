# ðŸ§® String to Integer (atoi)

## Problem Statement

Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1. Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (`" "`).
2. Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is `'-'` or `'+'`, assuming positivity if neither present.
3. Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
4. Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be rounded to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be rounded to `231 - 1`.

Return the integer as the final result.

## Examples

### Example 1
```code
Input: s = "42"

Output: 42

Explanation:

The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^
```

### Example 2
```code
Input: s = " -042"

Output: -42

Explanation:

Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
               ^
```

### Example 3
```code
Input: s = "1337c0d3"

Output: 1337

Explanation:

Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
```

### Example 4
```code
Input: s = "0-1"

Output: 0

Explanation:

Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
          ^
```

### Example 5
```code
Input: s = "words and 987"

Output: 0

Explanation:

Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.
```

**Constraints**

* `0 <= s.length <= 200`
* `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.

## Explanation of the Solution

The `myAtoi` function is essentially a state machine that parses a string to extract an integer. Both the Python and JavaScript solutions implement the same core algorithm, which can be broken down into the following steps.

### Algorithm Breakdown

1.  **Ignore Leading Whitespace**: The first step is to discard any whitespace characters at the beginning of the string.
    *   Python uses `s.lstrip()`.
    *   JavaScript uses `s.trimStart()`.

2.  **Determine the Sign**: After trimming whitespace, the code checks if the next character is a `'-'` or `'+'`.
    *   A `sign` variable is used to store this information (e.g., `-1` for negative, `1` for positive).
    *   If a sign character is found, the parser advances past it.

3.  **Read Digits**: The code then iterates through the subsequent characters as long as they are digits (`'0'` through `'9'`).
    *   In each iteration, the current digit is appended to the result. This is done mathematically with the formula: `num = num * 10 + digit`.

4.  **Apply Sign and Clamp**: Once the loop finishes (either by reaching a non-digit character or the end of the string), the determined sign is applied to the resulting number.
    *   Finally, the result is checked to see if it falls outside the 32-bit signed integer range (`[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`).
    *   If it's out of bounds, it is "clamped" to the nearest boundary (`INT_MIN` or `INT_MAX`). Otherwise, the number is returned as is.

### Overflow Handling Nuance

Unlike the "Reverse Integer" problem where intermediate 64-bit integers were forbidden, the `myAtoi` problem's constraints focus on the final output. The provided Python and JavaScript solutions leverage their respective language features:

*   **Python**: Uses arbitrary-precision integers, which can grow as large as needed before the final value is clamped.
*   **JavaScript**: Uses 64-bit floating-point numbers (IEEE 754), which can safely represent all integers up to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (a value much larger than the 32-bit `INT_MAX`).

A solution in a language with fixed 32-bit integers (like C++ or Java) would require checking for potential overflow *before* each `num = num * 10 + digit` operation, similar to the logic in the "Reverse Integer" solution.

## Solution (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        INT_MIN = -2**31
        INT_MAX = 2**31 - 1

        s = s.lstrip()
        if not s:
            return 0

        sign = 1
        i = 0

        if s[i] == '-' or s[i] == '+':
            sign = -1 if s[i] == '-' else 1
            i += 1

        num = 0

        while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():
            num = num * 10 + int(s[i])
            i += 1

        num *= sign

        if num < INT_MIN:
            return INT_MIN
        if num > INT_MAX:
            return INT_MAX

        return num
```

## Solution (Javascript)
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var myAtoi = function(s) {
    const INT_MIN = -2147483648;
    const INT_MAX = 2147483647;

    s = s.trimStart();
    if (s.length === 0) return 0;

    let i = 0;
    let sign = 1;

    if (s[i] === '-' || s[i] === '+') {
        sign = (s[i] === '-') ? -1 : 1;
        i++;
    }

    let num = 0;
    while (i < s.length && s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {
        num = num * 10 + (s[i].charCodeAt(0) - '0'.charCodeAt(0));
        i++;
    }

    num *= sign;

    if (num < INT_MIN) return INT_MIN;
    if (num > INT_MAX) return INT_MAX;
    return num;
};
